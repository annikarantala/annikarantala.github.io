## Introduction

This course on command-line tools covered various different topics and methods for using the command-line environment. On this page I will briefly describe and 
illustrate each week's topic, leading up to the final assignment of working with Jekyll and GitHub pages.

## Week 1

The first week of the course served as the introduction to working with command-line environments, and the work included setting up a working command-line environment 
on my device. For me this meant installing Ubuntu on my Windows computer, and learning to use it.

The commands I learned to use this week include things like the `cd` and `ls` commands for moving between directories and listing their contents, as well as `wget`
for downloading things from the internet into my directory. These and other basic commands I learned during this week have been very useful in my work throughout the 
course, and over time I have managed to acquire a great `touch` for using them. (Pun intended).

## Week 2

This week's content was centered around navigating a UNIX system and managing files and directories within that system. I also learned to connect to a remote server
and change the access rights to a file.

The commands I learned this week that I found myself using the most in the coming weeks and assignments were  
* `cp` for copying files
* `mv` for moving files between directories
* `rm` for deleting files and directories
* `tar` for extracting .tgz files

These commands were needed often in the later weeks' assignments, and they are obviously commands that are very essential to doing any work with command-line environments.
I familiarized myself with these commands and learned to use them quickly and naturally.

## Week 3

During the third week I learned about different text encoding systems, converting from one text file format to another (Windows vs. UNIX), and the basics of corpus processing
with command-line tools.
