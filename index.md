## Introduction

I am a 20-year-old second year student of general linguistics in Helsinki University. I'm especially interested in language technology and learning more about programming.

My free-time interests include playing Finnish baseball, reading books (especially psychological thrillers and literary fiction) and playing video games with my friends.
