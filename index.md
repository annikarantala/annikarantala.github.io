## Introduction

I am a 20-year-old second year student of general linguistics in Helsinki University. I'm especially interested in language technology and learning more about programming.

My free-time interests and hobbies include playing Finnish baseball, reading books (especially psychological thrillers and literary fiction) and playing video games with my friends.

## Projects

#### [Command-Line Project](https://github.com/annikarantala/cmdline-course-annikarantala)

A project for a Command-Line Tools -course I have been working on this fall (2021). The project includes learning to use Git repositories and running a text parsing script.

## Misc. 

I like to explore my creativity and self-expression in various ways. One of my more recent projects has been learning the basics of video editing, and the first finished product to come out of that is a little [compilation of highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAQu4w2vLq0) from a video game I have been playing with my friend.
